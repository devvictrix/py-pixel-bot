**Summary & Next Steps:**

- **v4.0.0 (Gemini-Powered Visual Intelligence): COMPLETE.**
- **v5.0.0 (AI-Driven Profile Generation): COMPLETE.**

**Mark-I v5.0.0, featuring the AI-Driven Profile Generator, is now functionally complete and documented.**
**Refactoring for v5.0.1 is COMPLETE.**
**Unit Test Infrastructure & Initial Coverage for v5.0.2 is COMPLETE.**

**Current Focus (v5.0.x):**
- **v5.0.1 Codebase Refactoring:** **DONE.**
- **v5.0.2 Implement Unit Test Infrastructure & Initial Coverage:** **DONE.**
    - `pytest` framework setup, `tests/` directory, and initial tests for `ConfigManager`, `gui_utils`, `ConditionEvaluators`, `PrimitiveExecutors`, `AnalysisEngine`, and `RulesEngine` are complete.
- **v5.0.3 Manual End-to-End (E2E) Testing:** (Status: `Planning`) The next logical step is to proceed with comprehensive manual E2E testing of all v5.0.0 features, including the AI Profile Generator and the execution of generated profiles, to ensure overall system stability, usability, and correctness after refactoring and initial unit test implementation.

**Future Considerations (Post v5.0.x):**
- Address any bugs or critical refinements identified during E2E testing (v5.0.3).
- Revisit the deferred "Profile Refinement Loop (Basic)" for the AI Profile Creator.
- Explore items listed under "vFuture" on the roadmap based on user feedback and project priorities.
- Continuous performance optimization and expansion of unit test coverage for remaining modules and new features.

The planned work for v5.0.2 (Implement Unit Test Infrastructure & Initial Coverage) is now complete.
