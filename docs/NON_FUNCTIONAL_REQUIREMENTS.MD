# Non-Functional Requirements

This document outlines the non-functional requirements for the visual automation tool, describing *how well* the system should perform its functions.

## NFR-PERF: Performance

*   **NFR-PERF-001: Low Latency Capture:** Screen capture of the defined region SHOULD be performed with minimal latency to enable near real-time analysis. Target latency should be low enough not to miss fast-changing visual cues relevant to typical use cases (e.g., gaming, UI updates).
*   **NFR-PERF-002: Efficient Analysis:** Image analysis operations (color checking, template matching, OCR) on the captured region SHOULD be computationally efficient. The duration of analysis should be significantly less than the capture interval for continuous monitoring.
*   **NFR-PERF-003: Configurable FPS/Interval:** For continuous monitoring, the capture/analysis loop speed (Frames Per Second or interval delay) SHOULD be configurable by the user to balance responsiveness and system load.
*   **NFR-PERF-004: Minimal System Impact:** While active, the bot SHOULD strive to minimize its impact on overall system performance (CPU, memory usage), especially when running in the background for extended periods.

## NFR-USAB: Usability

*   **NFR-USAB-001: Ease of Region Definition:** Defining the target screen region(s) SHOULD be straightforward, whether via CLI coordinates in a config file or the planned GUI tool.
*   **NFR-USAB-002: Intuitive Rule Creation:** Creating analysis rules and linking them to actions in the JSON configuration SHOULD be understandable with clear documentation. Future GUI tools must enhance this.
*   **NFR-USAB-003: Clear Feedback & Logging:** The system MUST provide clear feedback on its operations, detections, and any errors encountered. Comprehensive and persistent logging, configurable by environment (`APP_ENV`), MUST be implemented to facilitate debugging and operational monitoring. Logs should be structured and contain sufficient detail (timestamps, levels, source module, messages) for effective diagnostics.
*   **NFR-USAB-004: Interruptibility:** Users MUST be able to easily start, stop, or pause (if implemented) the bot's operation (e.g., via a CLI command or a signal like Ctrl+C).
*   **NFR-USAB-005: Configuration Clarity:** The JSON profile format SHOULD be well-documented and logically structured.

## NFR-ACCU: Accuracy

*   **NFR-ACCU-001: Precise Region Capture:** The captured image data MUST accurately correspond to the user-defined screen region coordinates.
*   **NFR-ACCU-002: Reliable Analysis Results:**
    *   Color detection SHOULD be accurate under consistent lighting/display conditions. Users should be able to configure color matching tolerance if implemented.
    *   Template matching SHOULD have configurable tolerance/confidence levels to balance strictness and flexibility.
    *   OCR (when implemented) SHOULD have reasonable accuracy for clear, standard fonts within the defined region. Confidence scores from the OCR engine, if available, SHOULD be logged and potentially usable in rules.
*   **NFR-ACCU-003: Consistent Action Execution:** Actions triggered (mouse clicks, key presses) SHOULD be performed reliably and accurately at the intended target locations or with the intended inputs.

## NFR-REL: Reliability & Robustness

*   **NFR-REL-001: Stable Operation:** The bot SHOULD operate stably for extended periods without crashing, especially during continuous monitoring. The background monitoring loop (per ADR-006) must be robust.
*   **NFR-REL-002: Graceful Error Handling:** The system MUST handle common errors gracefully (e.g., OCR engine failure, issues with screen capture permissions, invalid configuration). It should provide informative messages both to the user (if applicable via console) and to the logs. All exceptions should be caught and logged appropriately.
*   **NFR-REL-003: Resilience to Minor Visual Noise (Future):** Analysis techniques (especially template matching) SHOULD ideally offer options for some resilience to minor, non-critical visual noise within the monitored region.

## NFR-MAINT: Maintainability

*   **NFR-MAINT-001: Modular Code:** The codebase SHOULD be modular (e.g., capture, analysis, action, rules engines, config management) to promote separation of concerns and ease of updates.
*   **NFR-MAINT-002: Code Clarity & Documentation:** Code SHOULD be well-commented, and key functions/classes/modules SHOULD have docstrings (Google Python Style). Design decisions SHOULD be documented in ADRs. Code MUST include thorough logging at important steps.
*   **NFR-MAINT-003: Testability:** Core logic (especially analysis functions and rule evaluation) SHOULD be designed to be unit-testable, even if comprehensive unit tests are deferred.
*   **NFR-MAINT-004: Diagnosability:** The application MUST be highly diagnosable through its logging output, allowing developers and operators to understand its state and troubleshoot issues without requiring direct code inspection or debugging in production environments. Log levels and content should be appropriate for the `APP_ENV`.

## NFR-SEC: Security

*   **NFR-SEC-001: User Control & Awareness:** The bot operates with user permissions. Users MUST be aware that the bot is observing parts of their screen and can perform inputs. This should be clear in user documentation.
*   **NFR-SEC-002: No Unintended Data Transmission:** The bot SHOULD NOT transmit screen captures, configuration data, or logs over the network unless explicitly part of a user-configured feature (e.g., a future webhook action, which itself would need security considerations).
*   **NFR-SEC-003: Secure Configuration:** Configuration files (`.json` profiles, `.env`) are user-managed. If future features ever involve storing sensitive data (not currently planned), appropriate security measures would need to be considered then. The `.env` file should be added to `.gitignore`.

## NFR-CONF: Configurability

*   **NFR-CONF-001: Analysis Parameters:** Parameters for analysis (e.g., specific colors, template image paths, OCR language if applicable, image match confidence thresholds) MUST be configurable by the user via the profile.
*   **NFR-CONF-002: Action Parameters:** Details of actions (e.g., click coordinates/offsets, text to type) MUST be configurable.
*   **NFR-CONF-003: Logging Configuration:** Logging behavior (levels, output, format) MUST be primarily controlled via the `APP_ENV` variable, as detailed in ADR-007.
*   **NFR-CONF-004: Hotkey Configuration (Future):** Users MAY be able to configure global hotkeys for starting/stopping the bot.
*   **NFR-CONF-005: Core Loop Interval:** The interval/FPS of the main monitoring loop MUST be configurable.
