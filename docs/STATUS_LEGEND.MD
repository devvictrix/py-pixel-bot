# Status Legend for Feature Roadmap

This document defines the meaning of status indicators used in `FEATURE_ROADMAP.MD`.

*   **Not Started:** The feature has been identified and is on the roadmap, but no significant design or development work has begun.
*   **Planning:** Initial discussions, research, high-level design, or specification work for the feature is underway. The technical approach and detailed requirements are being formulated. This may involve creating or updating ADRs or `TECHNICAL_DESIGN.MD` sections.
*   **In Progress:** Active development (coding, initial component testing, documentation updates related to the feature) is currently happening. The feature is partially implemented but not yet complete or ready for full review/testing.
*   **Pending Review:** Development of the feature (including code, associated documentation updates like `TECHNICAL_DESIGN.MD`, and logging) is considered complete from the AI's perspective or after a development sprint. It is now ready for DevLead's detailed review, feedback, and approval before formal testing or final sign-off.
*   **Testing:** The feature implementation is complete and has passed initial DevLead review (or is ready for it). It is now undergoing manual integration testing, focused use-case testing, and bug fixing by DevLead to ensure it meets functional and non-functional requirements.
*   **Done:** The feature has been fully implemented, thoroughly tested by DevLead, documented according to the version's goals (e.g., `TECHNICAL_DESIGN.MD` updated, code docstrings complete, user-facing docs like `README.MD` updated for the feature), and has been approved/confirmed as complete by DevLead. It is considered stable for its intended version.
*   **Deferred:** The feature was considered but has been intentionally postponed to a later version or an indefinite future. Reasons for deferral might be noted.
*   **Blocked:** Progress on this feature is currently impeded by an external factor, an unresolved dependency on another incomplete feature, or a critical unanswered question. The blocking issue should be noted.
