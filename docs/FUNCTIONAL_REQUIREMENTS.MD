# Functional Requirements

This document outlines the functional requirements for the visual automation tool, describing *what* the system will do.

## FR-CORE: Core System

*   **FR-CORE-001: Cross-Platform Operation:** The bot SHOULD operate on Windows, macOS, and Linux.
*   **FR-CORE-002: Configuration Files:** The system MUST use JSON for saving and loading bot configurations (profiles), including region definitions, analysis rules, and associated actions.
*   **FR-CORE-003: Environment Configuration:** The system MUST read an `APP_ENV` variable (e.g., from a `.env` file) to determine its operational environment (e.g., `development`, `uat`, `production`), primarily influencing logging.
*   **FR-CORE-004: Logging:** The system MUST implement comprehensive logging at important operational steps, with log levels and destinations configurable based on `APP_ENV`, as detailed in `adrs/ADR-007-Logging-Strategy-and-Environment-Configuration.md`.

## FR-CAPTURE: Screen Region Capture Module

*   **FR-CAPTURE-001: Define Target Region:** The user MUST be able to define one or more rectangular regions on the screen to be monitored.
    *   Initially via coordinates in a configuration file.
    *   Later, via a GUI tool (target for AI-Accelerated v1.0.0).
*   **FR-CAPTURE-002: Capture Specified Region:** The system MUST be able to capture the image data only from the defined target region(s).
*   **FR-CAPTURE-003: Real-time/On-demand Capture:** The system MUST support continuous real-time capture (at a configurable FPS/delay) and MAY support on-demand single-frame capture of the target region(s).

## FR-ANALYZE: Region Analysis Module

*   **FR-ANALYZE-001: Pixel Color Analysis:** The system MUST allow users to check for specific pixel colors or average colors within the captured region.
*   **FR-ANALYZE-002: Basic Image Matching (Template Matching):** The system MUST allow users to check if a small user-provided template image (pixel pattern) is present within the captured region.
*   **FR-ANALYZE-003: OCR Text Extraction:** The system MUST be able to extract text from the captured region using OCR.
*   **FR-ANALYZE-004: Configurable Analysis Rules:** Users MUST be able to define rules or conditions based on the analysis output (e.g., "IF color IS red THEN...", "IF text CONTAINS 'Start' THEN...", "IF template 'icon.png' IS found THEN..."), as per `adrs/ADR-004-Rules-Engine-Design-for-Conditional-Logic.md`.

## FR-ACTION: Action Execution Module

*   **FR-ACTION-001: Mouse Click Simulation (Targeted):** The system MUST be able to simulate mouse clicks (left, right, middle) at specific coordinates *within the monitored region*, at its center, or at an offset relative to a found pattern/text.
*   **FR-ACTION-002: Keyboard Input Simulation:** The system MUST be able to simulate keyboard presses (character keys, special keys) and typing strings.
*   **FR-ACTION-003: Conditional Actions:** Actions MUST be triggerable based on the outcome of the analysis rules defined in FR-ANALYZE-004.
*   **FR-ACTION-004: Action Sequencing (Future):** The system MAY allow users to define a sequence of multiple actions to be performed if a condition is met.

## FR-CONFIG: Configuration & Management

*   **FR-CONFIG-001: Save/Load Bot Profile:** Users MUST be able to save the entire bot setup (defined regions, analysis rules, associated actions) to a JSON profile file and load it later.
*   **FR-CONFIG-002: Start/Stop Bot Operation:** Users MUST be able to start and stop the bot's monitoring and action execution loop via the CLI.
*   **FR-CONFIG-003: Multiple Profile Management (Future):** The system MAY support managing multiple bot profiles.

## FR-UI: User Interface

*   **FR-UI-001: CLI Control (Core):** The initial and core version MUST provide Command Line Interface (CLI) controls for:
    *   Loading a bot profile.
    *   Starting the monitoring and action loop.
    *   Stopping the monitoring and action loop.
*   **FR-UI-002: GUI for Region Definition (AI-Accelerated v1.0.0 Target):** A GUI tool SHOULD be provided for users to visually select/draw the screen regions to be monitored and save their coordinates.
*   **FR-UI-003: GUI for Rule/Action Configuration (Future):** Future versions MAY provide a GUI for building analysis rules and associating actions more visually.
*   **FR-UI-004: User Feedback:** The system MUST provide clear feedback to the user about its current state and operations, primarily through console output (influenced by logging configuration) and log files.
