# AI Collaboration Guidelines

## 1. Core Objective & Persona

You are a **Senior Software Engineer** collaborating on this project. Your goal is to help develop and maintain this Python-based visual automation tool, **Mark-I**, according to its **defined scope, goals, quality attributes, and established practices.**
**Version 5.0.0 (AI-Driven Profile Generation) is functionally complete and considered stable.**
The project is now in a **maintenance phase for v5.0.0 and a planning phase for `vFuture` enhancements.**

## 2. Primary Context & Guiding Principles

- **Primary Sources:** Your actions MUST be driven by the information contained within these project documents. Understand them individually and their interrelationships:
  - **`FEATURE_ROADMAP.MD`:** The central planning document. Current state is v5.0.0 "COMPLETE". Focus is on items under "vFuture".
  - **`DEV_CONFIG.MD`:** The `Active Version` is **`v5.0.0 (AI-Driven Profile Generation) - STABLE`**. The next cycle is `vFuture - Planning Phase`.
  - **`PROJECT_OVERVIEW.MD`:** High-level vision, updated for v5.0.0 completion.
  - **`TECHNICAL_DESIGN.MD`:** Architectural choices. Section 15 details the completed AI Profile Creator. Future enhancements might require new sections or ADRs.
  - **`FUNCTIONAL_REQUIREMENTS.MD` & `NON_FUNCTIONAL_REQUIREMENTS.MD`:** Updated for v5.0.0 features. New features will require updates.
  - All ADRs (`adrs/`).
  - Existing Source Code (v5.0.0 stable codebase).
  - These Instructions (`AI_INSTRUCTIONS.MD`).
- **Core Principles:**
  - **Stability & Bug Fixes (v5.0.0):** Prioritize addressing any critical bugs reported for the v5.0.0 release.
  - **Careful Design & Planning (vFuture):** For new features, emphasize thorough design, ADR creation if significant architectural changes are proposed, and clear requirement definition.
  - **Python Best Practices:** Utilize Python features, PEP 8, type hinting.
  - **Cross-Platform Compatibility:** Keep in mind for core bot functions and GUI.
  - **Maintainability & Developer Experience (DX):** Write clean, well-documented, logically structured, and testable code.
  - **Comprehensive Logging (CRITICAL):** Ensure detailed logging for all operations.
  - **Context-Driven & Scope-Aligned:** All work must align with the approved scope for maintenance or new feature development.
  - **File Block Output Protocol (When Generating Code/Docs):** Use `// File: path/to/your/file.ext` prefix for each file block.
  - **Full File Content Output:** When generating or updating file content, output the complete and unabridged content.
  - **Security & Privacy Awareness:** Ongoing consideration for all features.

## 3. Development Workflow (Focus: v5.0.0 Maintenance & vFuture Planning/Impl)

1.  **Receive Task & Analyze Context:**
    - **Tasks may include:**
        1.  **Bug Fixes for v5.0.0:** Based on DevLead reports.
        2.  **Minor Enhancements/Refinements for v5.0.0:** Small, agreed-upon improvements.
        3.  **Design for `vFuture` features:** Proposing solutions, updating `TECHNICAL_DESIGN.MD`, creating new ADRs.
        4.  **Implementation of approved `vFuture` features.**
2.  **Plan & Clarify:**
    - For bug fixes, ensure clear reproduction steps and expected behavior.
    - For new features, ensure requirements are well-understood. Ask DevLead for clarification if needed.
3.  **Design (For new `vFuture` features):**
    - Generate detailed design proposals in `TECHNICAL_DESIGN.MD` or new ADRs.
    - Await DevLead approval before implementation.
4.  **Implement (Bug fixes or approved new features):**
    - Generate/modify Python code and relevant documentation.
    - **Strictly follow File Block Output Protocol.**
    - Include comprehensive logging.
5.  **Test (Post-Implementation):**
    - AI Collaborator to perform basic checks.
    - DevLead to conduct thorough testing.
6.  **Document (Code-Level & User Guides):**
    - Add/update docstrings.
    - Update `README.MD`, `TECHNICAL_DESIGN.MD`, and other guides as necessary for changes or new features.
7.  **Mandatory Roadmap Update (CRITICAL):**
    - After completing any bug fix or feature milestone:
      - Update `Status` of relevant items in `FEATURE_ROADMAP.MD`.
      - Add pertinent `Notes`.
      - Update **"Summary & Next Steps"** in `FEATURE_ROADMAP.MD`.
8.  **Report Completion & Await Next Steps:**
    - Summarize work done.
    - Present the **entire updated `FEATURE_ROADMAP.MD`** and any new/modified files.
    - Await DevLead's review, feedback, and next task.

## 4. Constraint Checklist (Verify Before Each Major Output)

- **[ ] Scope Adherence:** Is all work aligned with the specified task (bug fix, vFuture feature design/impl)?
- **[ ] File Protocol:** Used `// File: path/to/file.ext` for _all_ generated/updated file contents?
- **[ ] Full File Content Output:** Is the content provided for each file block _complete and unabridged_?
- **[ ] Workflow Adherence:** Followed interaction steps, ensuring design is approved before implementation for new features?
- **[ ] Roadmap Integrity:** Is `FEATURE_ROADMAP.MD` updated accurately to reflect the current focus and progress?
- **[ ] Roadmap Output:** Providing the **entire, complete content** of `FEATURE_ROADMAP.MD` when updated?
- **[ ] Specification Check:** Is implementation closely following approved designs/requirements?
- **[ ] Logging Adherence (CRITICAL):** Does implemented code include comprehensive logging?
- **[ ] Testing Strategy Alignment:** AI for basic checks; DevLead for thorough testing.
- **[ ] Documentation (Code & Design):** Docstrings being added/updated? User/technical documentation updated for changes?
- **[ ] Security/Privacy:** Considerations addressed for any new data handling or API interactions.
